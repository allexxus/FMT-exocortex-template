# test-update-edge-cases.sh — edge-case regression tests for update.sh (issue #206)
#
# Covers gaps not exercised by smoke-test-fresh-install.sh:
#   T1: --check mode does not modify any file (idempotency guard)
#   T2: orphaned {{PLACEHOLDER}} in .iwe-runtime/ is detected post-build
#   T3: CLAUDE.md with pre-existing conflict markers blocks update (stacking guard)
#   T4: role install failure surfaces a visible warning (not silently swallowed)
#   T5: network-independent --check works with a cached manifest
#   T6: memory file with owner: user survives a hash mismatch (issue #229)
#   T7: hot-budget sum over threshold is detectable (issue #228)
#   T8: build-runtime.sh does not clobber an edited params.yaml (issue #327)
#   T9: .mcp.json migration preserves a third-party server like ext-figma (issue #335)
#   T10: CLAUDE.md fallback-merge (no .base) never silently drops §8/§9 edits (issue #336)
#   T11: protocol-artifact-validate.sh DayPlan checks (multiplier/mandatory/budget, issue #328)
#   T12: day-close.sh memory backup descends into memory/ subfolders (issue #343)
#   T13: iwe_scheduler_state separates "never deployed" from "deployed and dead" (issue #347)
#   T14: a fresh workspace is seeded with params.yaml from params.yaml.example (issue #348)
#   T15: residency-gate scripts resolve residency-gate.py from any cwd (issue #323)
#   T16: hooks newly registered in settings.json exist and honor the event protocol on a clean install (issues #310/#321/#323 batch)
#   T17: seed ships scripts/lib/ so a fresh governance install gets the scaffold dependency (issue #347)
#   T18: decision-log consumers share one canonical path and define cold-start/migration behavior (issue #351)
#   T19: orphan detection resolves the template independently of CWD and fails open (issue #353)
#   T20: index-health skip suppresses size checks but keeps semantic checks (issue #357)
#   T21: legacy owner:user protocols migrate once with backup; other user files stay protected (issue #354)
#   T22: Quick Close requires a runner card only when the runner and graph exist (issue #356)
#   T23: wp-sync-bundle handles canonical cards, phase statuses, relation shapes, titles, and linked worktrees
#   T24-T27: update safety, bootstrap/path contracts, multiplier opt-out, #384/#387/#388
#   T28: settings.json merge preview never touches inputs, honors merge rules (WP-7 F71)
#   T29: author_mode skip classifier verdicts on synthetic template history (WP-7 F71)
#   T30: update.sh wires stage-A observability scripts in (WP-7 F71)
#   T31: extensions-gate is fail-closed: traversal/symlink/broken-manifest/manifest-edit block (WP-7 F71)
#   T32: settings-merge-apply.sh applies with backup, rolls back on broken input (WP-7 F71 stage B)
#   T33: update.sh wires stage-B flags with consensus safeguards (WP-7 F71)
#   T34: Unicode context caps count characters, not bytes (issue #435)
#   T35: /extend catalog matches every invoked extension point (issues #436/#508)
#   T36: extension loader sorts suffixes and preserves no-op/error exit codes (issue #508)

## Допустимый переход

1. Тип состояния брать только из того же
   `docs/state-axes-registry.yaml` governance-репозитория, наличие которого
   активировало hot-триггер.
2. Использовать только ось с `gate_ready: true`.
3. Дать ссылку на объявленного владельца конечного автомата
   (`declared FSM-owner`) этой оси.
4. Свободный текст вместо зарегистрированного типа состояния не принимается.

Если тип не зарегистрирован, ось не имеет `gate_ready: true` или ссылка на
владельца отсутствует, разрешён только сбор фактов (`inventory`) → СТОП и
отложить нетривиальное действие или РП.

Для перехода по нескольким осям применять правила cross-axis из
`memory/reference/agent-core.md`. Авторская концептуальная модель может быть
доступна в `archive/wp-contexts/WP-457/CONCEPT-user-states.md §5`, но не является
обязательной для понимания и исполнения этого поставляемого контракта.

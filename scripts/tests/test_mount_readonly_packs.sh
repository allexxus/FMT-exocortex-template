# Regression test for read-only Pack mounting in the isolated inbox-check
# sandbox (WP-5, ArchGate 03.09): inbox-check.md never writes into a Pack by
# design (only the separate, pilot-triggered apply session does) -- but
# run_claude launches Claude with --dangerously-skip-permissions and
# Write/Edit tools allowed, so "don't write here" as prompt text alone is
# not a real control (same gap class as
# inbox/bugs/bug-2026-07-07-r15-decisions-bypassed-pilot.md). This test
# verifies the mount is actually read-only at the filesystem level, and that
# the real cleanup function can still remove it afterward.
#
# Extracts the functions straight out of the real extractor.sh (instead of
# sourcing the whole file, which guards against direct execution from the
# raw FMT checkout and requires a built runtime) via awk, and calls the real
# cleanup_isolated_inbox_worktree() -- not a hand-rolled equivalent -- so a
# regression in its actual pack-removal loop would fail this test (cold
# review 03.09 found the first version of this test didn't do that).
